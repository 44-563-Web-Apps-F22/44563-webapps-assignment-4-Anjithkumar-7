    <h3>The Pirates of Penzance</h3>
    <h4>ACT I</h4>
    <h5 class="Scene">
        (Scene.-A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall. In the
        distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
        Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage. Under these rocks is a
        cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L. A
        natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage. As the
        curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered — some drinking,
        some playing cards. SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
        one group to another, filling the cups from a flask. FREDERIC is
        seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene. RUTH
        kneels at his feet.)</h5>

        RECITATIVE
    <h4 class="ALL name">ALL:</h4>
    <p class="speech">Poor lad — poor lad!</p>
    <p class="direction">(All weep)</p>
    <h4 class="KING name">KING:</h4>
    <p class="speech"> Well, Frederic, if you conscientiously feel that it is
        your duty to destroy us, we cannot blame you for acting
        on that conviction. Always act in accordance with the
        dictates of your conscience, my boy, and chance the
        consequences.</p>
    <h4 class="SAMUEL name">SAMUEL:</h4>
    <p class="speech"> Besides, we can offer you but little temptation to
        remain with us. We don't seem to make piracy pay. I'm
        sure I don't know why, but we don't.</p>
    <h4 class="FREDRIC name">FREDERIC:</h4>
    <p class="speech">I know why, but, alas! I mustn't tell you; it wouldn't
        be right.</p>
    <h4 class="KING name">KING:</h4>
    <p class="speech"> Why not, my boy? It's only half-past eleven, and you
        are one of us until the clock strikes twelve.</p>
    <h4 class="SAMUEL name">SAMUEL:</h4>
    <p class="speech"> True, and until then you are bound to protect our
        interests.</p>
    <blockquote>SONG-ALL</blockquote>
    <h4 class="ALL name">ALL:</h4> <p class="song">Hear, hear!</p>
    <h4 class="FREDERIC name">FREDERIC:</h4> <p class="song">Well, then, it xis my duty, as a pirate, to tell you
    that you are too tender-hearted. For instance, you
    make a point of never attacking a weaker party than
    yourselves, and when you attack a stronger party you
    invariably get thrashed.</p>
    <h4 class="KING name">KING:</h4> <p class="song">There is some truth in that.</p>
    <h4 class="FREDERIC name">FREDERIC:</h4> <p class="song">Then, again, you make a point of never molesting an
    orphan!</p>
