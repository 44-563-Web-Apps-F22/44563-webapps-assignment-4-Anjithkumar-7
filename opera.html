    <h3>The Pirates of Penzance</h3>
    <h4>ACT I</h4>
    <h5>
        (Scene.-A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall. In the
        distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
        Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage. Under these rocks is a
        cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L. A
        natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage. As the
        curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered — some drinking,
        some playing cards. SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
        one group to another, filling the cups from a flask. FREDERIC is
        seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene. RUTH
        kneels at his feet.)</h5>

    <pre>
  ALL:      Poor lad — poor lad!  (All weep)
  KING:     Well, Frederic, if you conscientiously feel that it is
            your duty to destroy us, we cannot blame you for acting
            on that conviction.  Always act in accordance with the
            dictates of your conscience, my boy, and chance the
            consequences.
  SAMUEL:   Besides, we can offer you but little temptation to
            remain with us.  We don't seem to make piracy pay.  I'm
            sure I don't know why, but we don't.
  FREDERIC: I know why, but, alas! I mustn't tell you; it wouldn't
            be right.
  KING:     Why not, my boy?  It's only half-past eleven, and you
            are one of us until the clock strikes twelve.
  SAMUEL:   True, and until then you are bound to protect our
            interests.
  ALL:      Hear, hear!
  FREDERIC: Well, then, it is my duty, as a pirate, to tell you
            that you are too tender-hearted.  For instance, you
            make a point of never attacking a weaker party than
            yourselves, and when you attack a stronger party you
            invariably get thrashed.
  KING:     There is some truth in that.
  FREDERIC: Then, again, you make a point of never molesting an
            orphan!
