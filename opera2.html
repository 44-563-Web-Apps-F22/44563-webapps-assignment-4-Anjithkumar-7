    <h4 class="name SAMUEL">SAMUEL:</h4>
    <p class="speech">Of course: we are orphans ourselves, and know what it
        is.</p>
    <h4 class="name FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h4>
    <p class="speech">Yes, but it has got about, and what is the consequence?
        Every one we capture says he's an orphan. The last
        three ships we took proved to be manned entirely by
        orphans, and so we had to let them go. One would think
        that Great Britain's mercantile navy was recruited
        solely from her orphan asylums â€” which we know is not
        the case.</p>
    <h4 class="name SAMUEL">SAMUEL:</h4>
    <p class="speech">But, hang it all! you wouldn't have us absolutely
        merciless?</p>
    <h4 class="name FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h4>
    <p class="song">There's my difficulty; until twelve o'clock I would,
        after twelve I wouldn't. Was ever a man placed in so
        delicate a situation?</p>
    <br>
    <h4 class="name KING">KING:</h4>
    <p class="speech">Oh, he will take you with him.</p>
    <h4 class="name FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h4>
    <p class="song">Well, Ruth, I feel some difficulty about you. It is
        true that I admire you very much, but I have been
        constantly at sea since I was eight years old, and
        yours is the only woman's face I have seen during that
        time. I think it is a sweet face.</p>
