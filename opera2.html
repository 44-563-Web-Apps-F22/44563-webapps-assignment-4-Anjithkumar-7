    <h4 class ="name SAMUEL">SAMUEL:</h4> <p class="speech">Of course:  we are orphans ourselves, and know what it
    is.</p>
<h4 class = "name FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h4> <p class="speech">Yes, but it has got about, and what is the consequence?
    Every one we capture says he's an orphan.  The last
    three ships we took proved to be manned entirely by

    solely from her orphan asylums â€” which we know is not
    the case.</p>
<h4 class="name SAMUEL">SAMUEL:</h4>   <p class = "speech">But, hang it all!  you wouldn't have us absolutely
    merciless?</p>
<h4 class="name FREDERIC">FREDERIC:</h4> <p class ="song">There's my difficulty; until twelve o'clock I would,
